# Nimbus

**Nimbus** is a content creator's platform built on the [XION Blockchain](https://xion.burnt.com/).

## Goal
Nimbus allows content creators to sign up and upload content to the platform, while subscribers can subscribe to content from their favorite creators.

## How works

1. Content creator authenticates on the platform with their XION wallet.
2. The creator registers on the platform with a name or alias, so that they are enabled to register content.
3. The creator begins to add their content to the platform.
4. Subscribers browse Nimbus and register with specific content creators.
5. Creators enable subscriptions for periods and subscribers pay to access the content.
